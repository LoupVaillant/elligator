Using Elligator to Hide Key Exchanges
=====================================

Public keys can be distinguished from random noise in several ways,
and Elligator only addresses one of them.
To address the others,
we must avoid a couple death traps.

Properly hiding a key exchange involves four steps:

1. Chose an _ephemeral_ secret key at random,
   just like you would for a normal key exchange.
2. Generate a public key from that shared secret
   with a _special procedure_,
   described below.
3. Apply the Elligator&nbsp;2 inverse map to your public key.
   If it does not work go back to step (1).
   Otherwise you get its representative.
4. Serialise the representative into a random-looking byte stream.

<aside>
Though conceptually steps 3 and 4 are easier to describe separately,
it is generally a good idea to merge them to simplify the API.
</aside>


Step&nbsp;1: Chose an ephemeral secret key
------------------------------------------

Though the goal is to hide public keys as random noise,
it is trivial to detect if you're sending representatives of the same
key twice.
Which is why the keys you are trying to hide as random noise must be
used only once.
Those are called _ephemeral keys_.
Ephemeral keys may be used for several exchanges,
our only constraint is that they're sent only once.

Of course, ephemeral secret keys are chosen at random.


Step&nbsp;2: Generate a "special" public key
--------------------------------------------

Most key exchange algorithms do not work over the whole curve.
To avoid leaking information public keys always belong to the _prime
order subgroup_,
which comprises only a fraction of the curve.
Eavesdroppers could trivially notice if we only used those,
so we need a way to generate points on the _whole_ curve
and somehow make key exchange work regardless.

One obvious way to make it work is to _not_ clear the cofactor.
This means choosing a base point that generates the whole curve instead
of the prime order subgroup,
and choosing a uniformly random scalar between zero and the order of the
whole curve.

It is more practical however to find a way to be compatible with
existing key exchange algorithms.
This lets us retain the proofs and guarantees of the original
key exchange and streamline the APIs.
The details depend on the particular key exchange we want to be
compatible with.
Here we will give an example based on X25519 and X448.

<aside>
Okay that was a mouthful.
To get more familiar with elliptic curves we suggest you watch this
excellent [&ldquo;ECCHacks&rdquo; talk by Daniel J.&nbsp;Bernstein and
Tanja Lange][ECCHacks]
and read this [tutorial about &ldquo;cofactors&rdquo; and &ldquo;prime
order subgroups&rdquo;][cofactor].

### X25519 and X448

Those two key exchanges have the same structure:

- They both use a prime field GF(<var>p</var>),
  whose characteristic is close to a power of two.
- The order of their curve is a big prime number <var>&#x2113;</var>,
  multiplied by a small cofactor <var>h</var>
  (<var>h</var>&nbsp;=&nbsp;8 for Curve25519,
  and <var>h</var>&nbsp;=&nbsp;4 for Curve448).
- They both use a base point <var>G</var> of prime order
  <var>&#x2113;</var>.
- They both &ldquo;clamp&rdquo; the scalar in the same way.
- They both use an x-only Montgomery ladder,
  which ignores the sign of the point.
  That is,
  they act as if
  <var>P</var>&nbsp;=&nbsp;(<var>u</var>,&nbsp;<var>v</var>)
  and
  &minus;<var>P</var>&nbsp;=&nbsp;(<var>u</var>,&nbsp;&minus;<var>v</var>)
  were the same point.
  In practice, this means we can ignore <var>v</var> altogether.

The key exchange itself proceeds as follows:

- Alice generates a key pair (<var>a</var>,&nbsp;<var>A</var>),
  and sends <var>A</var> to Bob.
- Bob generates a key pair (<var>b</var>,&nbsp;<var>B</var>),
  and sends <var>B</var> to Alice.
- Alice and Bob compute the shared secret <var>S</var>.

The private keys <var>a</var> and <var>b</var> are random numbers.
The rest have the following values (the dot denotes scalar
multiplication):

- <var>A</var>&nbsp;=&nbsp;`clamp`(<var>a</var>)&nbsp;.&nbsp;<var>G</var>
- <var>B</var>&nbsp;=&nbsp;`clamp`(<var>b</var>)&nbsp;.&nbsp;<var>G</var>
- <var>S</var>&nbsp;=&nbsp;`clamp`(<var>a</var>)&nbsp;.&nbsp;<var>B</var>&nbsp;=&nbsp;`clamp`(<var>b</var>)&nbsp;.&nbsp;<var>A</var>

The `clamp`() operation is defined thus:

    clamp(s):
      clamped = s - s % h        # remove low bits
      clamped = clamped % 2^msb  # remove high bits
      clamped = clamped + 2^msb  # set high bit
      return clamped

Where `msb`&nbsp;=&nbsp;254 for Curve25519
and `msb`&nbsp;=&nbsp;447 for Curve 448.
This has two effects:

- It fixes the position of the highest non-zero bit.
  This [mitigates some side channel attacks][clamp] that may occur with
  some faulty implementations.

[clamp]: https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/cfrg/pt2bt3fGQbNF8qdEcorp-rJSJrc/

- It clears the lowest bits (3 for Curve25519, 2 for Curve448),
  so `clamp`(<var>s</var>) is a multiple of the cofactor <var>h</var>.
  This avoids leaking information about scalars by ignoring the low
  order component of points multiplied by a clamped scalar.
  Every point <var>A</var> is the sum of a prime order point
  <var>P</var> and a low order point <var>L</var>.
  Clamping ignores <var>L</var>:

  > `clamp`(<var>s</var>)&nbsp;.&nbsp;<var>A</var>&nbsp;=&nbsp;`clamp`(<var>s</var>)&nbsp;.&nbsp;(<var>P</var>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<var>L</var>)<br/>
  > `clamp`(<var>s</var>)&nbsp;.&nbsp;<var>A</var>&nbsp;=&nbsp;`clamp`(<var>s</var>)&nbsp;.&nbsp;<var>P</var>&nbsp;+&nbsp;`clamp`(<var>s</var>)&nbsp;.&nbsp;<var>L</var><br/>
  > `clamp`(<var>s</var>)&nbsp;.&nbsp;<var>A</var>&nbsp;=&nbsp;`clamp`(<var>s</var>)&nbsp;.&nbsp;<var>P</var><br/>

Normal public keys (almost) cover the whole prime order subgroup.
To cover the whole curve,
we just need to add a random low order point to it.
That low-order component will be ignored in key exchanges,
yielding the same shared secrets as we would have had with the normal
public key.

<aside>
Actually,
normal public keys only cover _half_ of the prime order group
(this is another effect of clamping).
But it does so in such a manner that for almost any prime order point
<var>P</var>,
either <var>P</var> or &minus;<var>P</var> (and not both) will be
covered.
X25519 and X448 get away with this because their scalar multiplication
ignores the sign of <var>P</var>.
In practice we can cover the whole prime order group by randomly
selecting the sign of the public key.

Alternatively,
we _may_ get away with _preserving_ the sign of the public key instead.
Even though we would only cover half the curve this way,
there is (as of 2022) no known fast way to detect which half of the
curve a public key belongs to.
This require that we either [recover the sign of the public
key](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F3-540-44709-1_12.pdf),
or use a scalar multiplication that preserves it.
</aside>

There are two methods to add a random low order point:

1. Generate a normal public key,
   then add a random low order point,
   selected with the clamped bits of the secret key.
2. Use a generator that generates the whole curve
   (and not just the prime order subgroup),
   and tweak the scalar to counter the effects of clamping.

Done right,
the two methods yield the exact same results.

<aside>
Actually,
since key exchange clears the cofactor,
the two methods do not have to yield the exact same results to be
compatible.
The reason we strongly recommend bit-for-bit identical outputs
is because it is much easier to test.
</aside>


### Method&nbsp;1: add a random low order point

This method is conceptually simple
but it requires generic point addition,
which is best done in Edwards space.
This means performing the scalar multiplication in Edwards space,
adding the low order point,
then converting the final results to Montgomery space so Elligator can
work.

The main advantage of this method is speed.
Generic Edwards addition allow some impressive
[optimisations](https://loup-vaillant.fr/tutorials/fast-scalarmult).
On the other hand,
this involves a fair bit of code and sizeable pre-computed tables.
This may be a problem on constrained applications that do not already
use Edwards code for other purposes,
like signatures.

We start with the following:

- The random secret bit string <var>s</var>, freshly generated for a
  single key exchange
  (256 bits for Curve25519,
  448 bits for curve448).
- the cofactor <var>h</var> of the curve
  (8 for Curve25519,
  4 for Curve448).
- The generator <var>G</var> of the prime order group of the curve
  (the one used in Ed25519 or Ed448).
- The generator <var>H</var> of the _low_ order group of the curve.
  It must be of order <var>h</var>.
  Curve25519 has 4 suitable candidates.
  Curve448 has 2.

The Edwards point
<var>E</var>&nbsp;=&nbsp;(<var>x</var>,&nbsp;<var>y</var>) is generated
from <var>a</var> as follows:

- <var>E<sub>high</sub></var>&nbsp;=&nbsp;`clamp`(<var>s</var>)&nbsp;.&nbsp;<var>G</var>
- <var>E<sub>low</sub></var>&nbsp;=&nbsp;(<var>s</var>&nbsp;`mod`&nbsp;<var>h</var>)&nbsp;.&nbsp;<var>H</var>
- <var>E</var>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<var>E<sub>high</sub></var>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<var>E<sub>low</sub></var>

<aside>
<var>E<sub>low</sub></var> may be computed with
[constant time](https://bearssl.org/constanttime.html)
selection and a very small pre-computed table.
Ed448 can even avoid the point addition entirely with a conditional swap
and two conditional negations.
</aside>

Once <var>E</var>&nbsp;=&nbsp;(<var>x</var>,&nbsp;<var>y</var>) is
generated,
we convert it to the Montgomery point
<var>P</var>&nbsp;=&nbsp;(<var>u</var>,&nbsp;<var>v</var>).
The conversion formula depends on the curve.

<aside>
Ed448 has an additional complication:
Ed448Goldilocks is not birationally equivalent to Curve448,
it is _isogenous_.
Converting it directly effectively introduces a multiplication by two,
which nullifies the point of order 2.
We would end up covering only half the curve and defeat the whole point
of Elligator.
To counter that we must convert <var>E<sub>high</sub></var> to the
birationally equivalent Edwards curve _before_ we add
<var>E<sub>low</sub></var>.
</aside>

<aside>
We don't need the <var>v</var> coordinate here.
It is ignored by the key exchange,
Elligator only needs its sign,
and we have to randomly flip that sign anyway to cover the whole curve.
(We do need <var>v</var> for blind signatures,
but those are an entirely separate problem.)
</aside>

Once we have <var>P</var>&nbsp;=&nbsp;(<var>u</var>,&nbsp;?)
we just need to check whether it can be mapped
(this only depends on <var>u</var>).
If it cannot,
we try again with a new random scalar <var>s</var>.
If it can,
we randomly decide whether <var>v</var> is a principal square root or
not,
and apply the inverse map.


### Method&nbsp;2: use a generator of the whole curve

This method reuses the x-only Montgomery ladder we use for
regular key exchanges,
and allows very compact code.
On the other hand,
it is about twice as slow as method&nbsp;1.

We start with the following:

- The random secret bit string <var>s</var>, freshly generated for a
  single key exchange
  (same as method&nbsp;1).
- the cofactor <var>h</var> of the curve
  (8 for Curve25519,
  4 for Curve448).
- The generator <var>G</var> of the prime order group of the curve.
  We use the same as method&nbsp;1.
- The generator <var>H</var> of the _low_ order group of the curve.
  We use the same as method&nbsp;1.

We can then pre-compute the special base point <var>K</var>:

- Find <var>m</var> such that
  <var>m</var>&nbsp;<var>&#x2113;</var>&nbsp;&equiv;&nbsp;1&nbsp;(`mod`&nbsp;<var>h</var>)
  (<var>m</var>&nbsp;=&nbsp;5 for X25519,
  <var>m</var>&nbsp;=&nbsp;3 for X448)
- <var>K</var>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<var>G</var>&nbsp;+&nbsp;(<var>m</var>&nbsp;.&nbsp;<var>H</var>)

<aside>
We can compute this in Edwards space,
then convert the result to a Montgomery point.
With Curve448, mind the isogeny:
if you make the addition within Ed448Goldilocks the resulting point will
not cover the whole curve.
</aside>

With <var>K</var> hard coded,
we can compute the rest entirely in Montgomery space,
with a single scalar multiplication:

- <var>s<sub>clamp</sub></var>&nbsp;=&nbsp;`clamp`(<var>s</var>)
- <var>s<sub>low</sub></var>&nbsp;=&nbsp;(<var>s</var>&nbsp;`mod`&nbsp;<var>h</var>)&nbsp;<var>&#x2113;</var>
- <var>P</var>&nbsp;=&nbsp;(<var>s<sub>clamp</sub></var>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<var>s<sub>low</sub></var>)&nbsp;.&nbsp;<var>K</var>

This gives us the exact same point <var>P</var> as method&nbsp;1.

Step&nbsp;3: Apply the inverse map
----------------------------------

To apply the [inverse map](map),
we suggest you use our [optimised formulas](formulas).

Note that not all public keys are eligible for the inverse map,
so this step will fail half the time on average.
When it does,
just go back to step (1) and generate a new random ephemeral key.

<aside>
While the &ldquo;check and retry&rdquo; approach is not constant time,
as long as the keys were properly selected at random leaking the number
of tries will not reveal anything else.
</aside>


Step&nbsp;4: Properly serialise the representative
--------------------------------------------------

The inverse map only generates principal square roots.
That is, half of all possible representatives.
If we sent that directly over the network,
it would be easy for an eavesdropper to notice that one bit is
effectively always zero,
and suspect our use of Elligator.
There are two ways to mitigate this problem:

- We can flip the sign of <var>r</var> at random.
  That is, half the time, we choose &minus;<var>r</var> instead of
  <var>r</var>
  (use constant time selection to do this).
  This will not affect the direct map when we try to recover the point
  <var>P</var> because
  `map`(<var>r</var>)&nbsp;=&nbsp;`map`(&minus;<var>r</var>).
- If the bit-string representation of a principal square root
  systematically leaves one of its bits cleared
  then we can replace it by a random bit instead.
  Of course,
  we must ignore that random bit when we parse the bit-string back.

Furthermore,
we generally send _byte_-strings over the network.
If the length of the bit-string is not a multiple of&nbsp;8,
the remaining bits must be filled with random data for the whole byte
string to look random.
Of course,
we must ignore those random bits when we parse the bit-string.


Suggested API design
--------------------

There are two main routes the API could go:
It could be _deterministic_,
or it could call an RNG internally.
The former is easier to test while the latter is easier to use.
If you can,
we suggest that you write a low-level deterministic API that you can
thoroughly test,
then implement an easy to use high-level API on top of it.

Here's what a good low level deterministic API might look like:

    void generate_public_key(uint8_t       public_key[KEY_SIZE],
                             const uint8_t secret_key[KEY_SIZE]);

    int  inverse_map(uint8_t       representative[KEY_SIZE],
                     const uint8_t public_key    [KEY_SIZE],
                     uint8_t       random_tweak);

    void direct_map(uint8_t       public_key    [KEY_SIZE],
                    const uint8_t representative[KEY_SIZE]);

The first function generates a public key from a secret key.
It can be implemented with _method&nbsp;1_ or _method&nbsp;2_,
depending on your use case
(_method&nbsp;1_ is potentially faster,
_method&nbsp;2_ potentially requires less code).
Implementing both methods and verifying that they behave identically can
also be a good test.

The direct and inverse maps behave as expected.
Note the added `random_tweak` for the inverse map,
that provides the randomness needed to select the sign of the
<var>v</var> coordinate and properly serialising the representative.

In practice the inverse map is only used with a fresh public key that
was generated with the special procedure
(_method&nbsp;1_ or _method&nbsp;2_).
On top of that it fails half the time,
forcing us to generate a new key pair and try again until it works.
It makes sense to provide a higher-level function that handles the whole
procedure:

    void key_pair_deterministic(uint8_t representative[KEY_SIZE],
                                uint8_t secret_key    [KEY_SIZE],
                                uint8_t random_seed[32]);

The `random_seed` can be expanded with a stream cipher to provide enough
randomness for an unlimited number of retries,
so that the whole function never fails.
_(And it is automatically wiped after use,
which is why it is not `const`.)_

Note that this function does not need to provide the public key itself:
the party that generates it will send the representative over the
network,
then only use the `secret_key` for key exchanges.
Of course, the recipient will need the `direct_map()` to convert the
representative they received and complete their end of the key exchange.

Finally,
you can provide one high-level function that gathers the randomness
itself:

    void key_pair_easy(uint8_t representative[KEY_SIZE],
                       uint8_t secret_key    [KEY_SIZE]);

It could call `key_pair_deterministic()` under the hood,
or use the low level functions directly.
