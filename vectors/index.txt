Elligator&nbsp;2 test vectors
=============================

Test vector files look like the following:

    bd568cb3a2d38a12:
    176daa5925e7975e:
    4e3ec9a72c828900:

    8b5f64295c8ec02f:
    aea6d1e57cacf85e:
    4527a25db227f764:

    ...

Each line is either empty,
or contain a number represented in hexadecimal
(in Little Endian)
followed by a colon (`:`).

The non-empty lines describe the input and outputs of test cases.
The empty lines separate the different test cases.

We have 3 types of tests:

- __Direct map:__ Each test have 3 vectors:
   1. (input) The representative <var>r</var> of the point.
   2. (output) The <var>u</var> coordinate of the point.
   3. (output) The <var>v</var> coordinate of the point.

- __Inverse map:__ Each test have 4 vectors:
   1. (input) The <var>u</var> coordinate of the point.
   2. (input) The sign of the <var>v</var> coordinate
      ("`00:`" if positive, "`01:`" if negative)
   3. (output) Whether the map should succeed ("`00:`")
      or fail ("`ff:`")
   4. (output) The representative of the point,
      or just "`:`" if the inverse map is supposed to fail.

- __Scalar multiplication:__ Each test have 2 vectors:
   1. (input) The private key (the scalar <var>s</var>).
   2. (output) The public key
      (<var>s</var>&nbsp;.&nbsp;<var>K</var>).

A couple caveats to keep in mind:

- The representatives are _not_ [properly serialised](/key-exchange).
  They are all positive,
  and all padding bits are set to zero.
  Real implementations should make sure that the inverse map makes _all_
  bits look random,
  and the direct map can correctly handle out of range inputs
  (ignore padding bits and/or correctly read negative representatives).

- The scalar multiplications described by the test vectors here produce
  keys that are compatible with X25519 and X448 respectively,
  But they're certainly not identical.
  Do _not_ use regular X25519 or X448 public key generations for keys
  you intend to hide with the inverse map.
  Use one of the [special procedures](/key-exchange) we describe
  instead.

Here are the test vectors, for Curve25519 and Curve448 respectively:

- [curve25519\_direct.vec](curve25519_direct.vec)
- [curve25519\_inverse.vec](curve25519_inverse.vec)
- [curve25519\_scalarmult.vec](curve25519_scalarmult.vec)
- [curve448\_direct.vec](curve448_direct.vec)
- [curve448\_inverse.vec](curve448_inverse.vec)
- [curve448\_scalarmult.vec](curve448\_scalarmult.vec)

They are generated with [these scripts](/elligator-reference.tar.gz)
(also available in [html](/src)).
